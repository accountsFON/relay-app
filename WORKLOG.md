# Relay — Work Log

Running **task list + shipped log** for the Relay app, maintained across Claude
Code sessions on Julio's machine. Updated when a task ships and pushed to
`main`, so a `git pull` always shows the latest. Newest first.

Every shipped item below was built with tests (TDD), passed CI (Typecheck &
Test), and was deployed to prod (`accountsfons-projects/relay-app`).

## Open / in progress

- [ ] **Client thread cut off at the bottom (relay detail page)** — _root-caused, fix pending_
  The client thread's chat box gets clipped by the bottom of the screen. One
  root cause, two severities, confirmed live in-browser:
  - **Mobile (fully hidden):** the floating-chat bottom sheet sets only a
    `max-h-[85dvh]`, never a definite height, so the message list grows to its
    natural length (measured ~1267px inside a 567px sheet) and shoves the pinned
    composer ~645px below the screen — you see only history, no chat box.
  - **Desktop (Send button half-clipped):** the sticky right rail's
    `max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)]` doesn't subtract the 48px top bar + 16px sticky
    offset, so its bottom lands ~32px below the fold — exactly where Send sits —
    and the rail is maxed out so you can't scroll to it.
  - **Fix (tested live):** give the mobile sheet a definite `h-[85dvh]` +
    `overflow-hidden` + safe-area bottom inset; change the desktop rail +
    thread card to `max-h-[calc(100dvh-5rem)]`. Files:
    `src/components/activity/mobile-thread-fab.tsx`,
    `src/app/(app)/clients/[id]/batches/[batchId]/page.tsx`.

## Notes / standing rules

- **Mobile:** every UI change is tested and adapted for phone width before it ships.
- **Hyperlinks:** any URL in user-entered free text is auto-linked, opens in a new tab, and wraps if long (centralized in `src/lib/linkify.ts` + `<Linkify>`).

## Shipped

- [x] **2026-06-15 — Hyperlinks clickable app-wide** (`a0f9923`, `431a051`)
  URLs in thread comments, post captions / graphic hook / designer notes,
  markup pin comments, and review-session captions now auto-link, open in a new
  tab, and long URLs wrap instead of breaking layout. Reusable `lib/linkify.ts`
  (`splitOnUrls`) + `<Linkify>` component. Profile fields already had it.

- [x] **2026-06-10 — Mobile: relay timeline + action bar** (`c5efdce`)
  Relay stage timeline is now one horizontal swipe track on every viewport
  (was a 13-row vertical stack on mobile). Batch action buttons (Preview / Open
  in Canva / Open client / Send link) are a horizontal scroll bar on mobile
  instead of wrapping into stacked rows.

- [x] **2026-06-10 — Batch controls cleanup** (`fb84120`)
  "Collapse all / Expand all" restyled from borderless text to a clear bordered
  button. "Show archived" posts toggle removed (with its query plumbing).

- [x] **2026-06-10 — Inbox: Mark all as read = primary** (`7662690`)
  "Mark all as read" is the prominent primary action (greyed/disabled when
  nothing is unread); "Clear all" demoted to a subtle ghost. Also fixed a scope
  bug where mark-all-read crossed orgs.

- [x] **2026-06-10 — Inbox: scope + notify + paginate** (`760b8f9`)
  Inbox + bell scoped to the viewer's assigned clients (AM/designer; admins see
  all). Content-generation completion now always notifies the triggerer + the
  assigned AM. Inbox lazy-loads 10 with a "Load more" button.

- [x] **2026-06-10 — Terminology unification** (`574e334`)
  "Relay" replaces "batch" in all user-facing copy. "Content Generation" is the
  generation-event term (with "runs" as casual shorthand). Models/routes
  unchanged internally.

- [x] **2026-06-10 — Content runs: clickable + retention** (`0982242`)
  Content-gone runs hidden from the client list; clicking a run whose batch was
  archived now lands on it; retention extended to 67 days (auto-archive 37 +
  purge 30).

- [x] **2026-06-10 — Avatar fallback in completion lap** (`7ded0c9`)
  The "Relay complete" celebration shows a participant's Clerk profile photo as
  a fallback when they haven't uploaded an avatar (defers to uploads).
